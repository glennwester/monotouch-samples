tvRemote
==============

Users of your Xamarin.tvOS app will not be interacting with it's interface directly as with iOS where they tap images on the device's screen, but indirectly from across the room using the Siri Remote.

This sample presents several ways that your Xamarin.tvOS app can interact with the Siri Remote to navigate your User Interface.

Build Requirements
------------------

WARNING! Xamarin.iOS 9.3.x introduces preview supports for iOS 9.1, tvOS 9.0 and updated previews for watchOS 2.0. The latest Xcode 7.1 is required to test the new features.

Building this sample requires the preview release of Xamarin.tvOS from [here](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/tvos/getting-started/installation/).

These previews are very early, unsupported builds to allow developers to test the new features and platforms recently announced by Apple and for Xamarin to gather feedback and bug reports. Your help is very appreciated!

Runtime Requirements
------------------

This sample can be launched on the tvOS Simulator and real 4th generation Apple TV hardware.
